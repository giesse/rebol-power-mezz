<FONT COLOR="#000099"><B><U>Synopsis</U>:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="+2">&nbsp;</FONT><BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; As many students, engineers, and over-unity researchers may already know, it's <I>very</I> hard to find a good <I>single</I> Internet reference resource which soundly assesses the <A HREF="./faradisk.html" target="newWindow" onclick="window.open('new.html','newWindow','toolbar=no,directories=no,menubar=no, scrollbars=no, resizable=no,width=600,height=450');"><FONT COLOR="#000099">early Faraday induction dynamo</FONT></A> in comparison to a latter-day derivative &#150; the &quot;unipolar generator&quot;. Basic engineering design information on either device is often inaccurate or misleading, and sometimes erroneous. Quite a number of determined inventors and experimenters have attempted to develop a &quot;formal&quot; <I>self-sustaining</I> over-unity variant of the disk dynamo which was &#171;unipolar&#187; in that it was <I>statorless</I>, but none have ever really succeeded.<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR></FONT>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp; The fact that a few <I>have</I> actually demonstrated a &quot;free energy&quot; operational power gain is important to point out in this turbulent time, when a definitive breakthrough in over-unity electrical power generation is needed so imperatively and so few people are having any real success at achieving one that is <I>practical</I>. Therefore, we are pleased to offer this webpage as a concise but detailed engineering analysis of these fascinating machines, one that appears to be much-needed, in order to foster a proper understanding of them and to assist students and alternative energy enthusiasts in their researches.<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><BR></FONT>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; A Faraday dynamo or unipolar generator doesn't lend itself well to practical commercial development because of the nature of its output, since it produces very low (even fractional) DC voltage at extremely high current. When Nikola Tesla invented polyphase alternating current near the end of the 19th century, the concentrated development of DC power systems based on Faraday's <I>original</I> work virtually ceased. However, Faraday dynamos and generators <I>are</I> well-suited to easy and precise mathematical modeling, both mechanically and electrically. <FONT COLOR="#000066">If we clearly show that formal* over-unity operation <I>can</I> be achieved with this technology, it could be that due cause is indicated for its renewed development &#150; given recent advances in solid-state DC-DC current conversion and regulation.</FONT> And while Michael Faraday's simple &quot;new electrical machine&quot; may not really be suitable for commercial-scale power generation, as we will see, it's quite possible that a <I>stand-alone residential power plant</I> could be developed from it!<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><A NAME="definitions"><BR></FONT>

&nbsp;* For present purposes, we shall define a &quot;formal&quot; or <I>self-sustaining</I> over-unity device as &quot;an electrical machine or self-contained system that, once started, will operate entirely on its own output <I>and</I> supply excess power to a load with no external input energy being provided thereafter <I>by the operator</I>.&quot; Thus, <FONT COLOR="#000066">an electrical device that operates <I>over-unity</I> is one wherein the dynamic ambient-energy environment contributes sufficient input energy that <U><I>the true ratio of net power output to gross operator input power</I></U> [the device's &quot;net output coefficient of performance&quot;, or COP<FONT SIZE="-2">(NO)</FONT>] <I>is greater than one (1)</I>.</FONT> In the case of a typical Faraday dynamo, of course, operator input is made in the form of <I>applied torque</I>.<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><BR></FONT>

 &nbsp;&nbsp; To put AESI's own work and that of <I>every</I> other over-unity systems R&D team in the right perspective, and as a reference resource that OU enthusiasts may not ever have seen elsewhere, it will be helpful to define the following <U>four (4) fundamental interpretations of COP</U>, with a relevant example. The four COP figures (wattage ratios) below show the radical effect that one's choice of interpretation or definition has on the <I>apparent</I> performance of any given over-unity system, and represent a <I>hypothetical</I> 18&quot;-diameter Faraday disk dynamo driven by a standard 1-Hp electric motor. Each of these simple definitions may be useful in certain cases but only one of them is always &quot;correct&quot;<B>:</B><FONT SIZE="-2"><BR><BR></FONT>

(i) &quot;<U>peak design COP</U>&quot; = ratio of <FONT COLOR="#0000CC">gross output</FONT> to net input (e.g., <FONT COLOR="#0000CC">1,248<FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">W</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT>/<FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT>746<FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">W</FONT> = <B>1.673</B>)<FONT SIZE="-2"><BR><BR></FONT>

(ii) &quot;<U>peak output COP</U>&quot; = ratio of gross output to <FONT COLOR="#CC0033">gross input</FONT> (e.g., 1,248<FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">W</FONT><FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT>/<FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#CC0033">900<FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">W</FONT></FONT> = <B>1.386</B>)<FONT SIZE="-2"><BR><BR></FONT>

(iii) &quot;<U>net input COP</U>&quot; = ratio of <FONT COLOR="#6600CC">net output</FONT> to <FONT COLOR="#CC0066">net input</FONT> (e.g., <FONT COLOR="#6600CC">882<FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">W</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT>/<FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#CC0066">746<FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">W</FONT></FONT> = <B>1.182</B>)<FONT SIZE="-2"><BR><BR></FONT>

(iv) &quot;<FONT COLOR="#000099"><U>net output COP</U></FONT>&quot; = <FONT COLOR="#000099">ratio of <FONT COLOR="#3333FF"><I>net</I></FONT> output to <FONT COLOR="#3333FF"><I>gross</I></FONT> input</FONT> (e.g., 882<FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">W</FONT><FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT>/<FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT>900<FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">W</FONT> = <FONT COLOR="#000099"><B>0.980</B></FONT>)<FONT SIZE="-2"><BR><BR></FONT>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; It can be seen here that the <I>&quot;inherent&quot; COP</I> of this particular disk dynamo would be properly OU by the <I>net input</I> definition, but that the disk-dynamo & motor system is <B>not</B> over-unity by the fourth and most stringent measure of I/O efficiency &#150; the net output COP! The typical drive motor is 746<FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT>/<FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT>900 or ~83% efficient and, curiously enough, while this hypothetical Faraday dynamo would indeed be OU in nature, its <FONT COLOR="#000099"><I>intrinsic generator efficiency</I> (or ratio of net power output to gross power generated)</FONT> is still only 882<FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT>/<FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT>1,248 = 70.7% due to its substantial internal resistive losses! And, while the peak &quot;design&quot; COP of this system is very impressive indeed, it obviously <I>cannot</I> operate in a self-sustaining mode.<BR><A NAME="intro"><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#CC3399"><B><U>Introduction</U>:</B></FONT>&nbsp; Before we make any detailed analyses of the Faraday disk machines, it will be useful to briefly summarize their essential mechanical and magnetic characteristics. The disk induction dynamo shown below exemplifies the following form of Faraday's Law of Induction: <FONT COLOR="#000099">an <I>electromotive force</I> [emf, or voltage] will be induced in any conductor that is moving across or &quot;cutting&quot; magnetic flux lines, and the emf is proportional to the rate at which the flux lines are being cut.</FONT> Thus, the rotating disk cuts the flux produced by the stationary magnet field pieces, and a voltage appears between the inner and outer edges of the disk in such a machine &#150; also commonly known as a <I>homopolar generator</I>.<SUB>&nbsp;</SUB>

<p align="justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, we now know with a certainty that the rotor of such a generator is subject to a <I>magnetic back-torque</I> that is proportional to the output current drawn, due to the operation of Lenz's Law, which states that: <FONT COLOR="#000099">a current set up by an emf induced due to the motion of a closed-circuit conductor will be in such a direction that its magnetic field will oppose the motion causing the emf.</FONT> But, as it turns out, it is this same 'limiting' principle which allows this device &#150; and nearly all common rotating power generation equipment &#150; to also function as an electric motor<B>:</B> if the appropriate voltage and current are supplied, in this case between the center and edge of the conductive rotor, the disk will rotate with about the same motor torque as it requires for a corresponding level of generator action.<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><BR></FONT>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; Curiously enough, shortly after Faraday's initial experiments with a primitive version of the induction dynamo he discovered that <FONT COLOR="#000099"><I>the same voltage could be induced if the magnetic field pieces were affixed directly to the rotor,</I> but that no voltage at all would be induced if the field pieces were rotated while the conductive disk was held stationary!</FONT> He logically inferred that even if the field pieces were rotating, their magnetic fields must be <I>stationary</I>, and that the type of uniform magnetic field produced by a cylindrical magnet must therefore be a property of space itself (or perhaps more accurately, space-time) and was independent of the magnetic material which serves to create the field. <FONT COLOR="#000066">[This quality or effect is an oddity which to this day has no truly satisfactory explanation, though a very good paper from the University of Maryland (Dept. of Physics; Berg & Alley, 2005) strongly suggests the real explanation may lie within the purview of <I>Special Relativity:</I> see <A HREF="http://www.physics.umd.edu/lecdem/outreach/QOTW/arch11/q218unipolar.pdf" target="NewWindow"><FONT COLOR="#0000CC">www.physics.umd.edu/ . . . q218unipolar.pdf</FONT></A>.]</FONT><FONT SIZE="-2"><BR><BR></FONT>

<CENTER><FONT COLOR="#CC0033"><B><U><I>incorrect</I> interpretation of statorless generator action</B></U>, promulgated by certain researchers.</FONT></CENTER>

<FONT SIZE="-2"><BR></FONT>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Direct experimentation</I> seems to show that  <FONT COLOR="#660099">a statorless &quot;unipolar&quot; generator (like that shown above) <I>can no longer also serve as a motor</FONT>,</I> though the reason(s) why this should be so are still hotly debated by theorists.* Presumably, it's because the magnetic field produced by an applied rotor current cannot 'properly' oppose that produced by field magnets which are rotor-mounted, in &quot;normal&quot; accordance with Lenz's Law. A <I>seemingly</I> logical inference then drawn by certain researchers, perhaps most notably the late Bruce DePalma (a physics professor at MIT) and electrical engineer Paramahamsa Tewari in India, was that <FONT COLOR="#CC0033">a statorless generator therefore <I>would not exhibit the expected Lenz losses</I> [as back-torque] <I>provided that the magnets used are nonconductive</I></FONT> &#150; and thus it should most <I>assuredly</I> be capable of operating at over-unity output levels! &nbsp;*<FONT SIZE="-2">[for <I>1</I> analysis, see: <A HREF="http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/sep99/937493491.Ph.r.html" target="NewWindow"><FONT COLOR="#990099">www.madsci.org/posts/archives/sep99/937493491.Ph.r.html</FONT></A>]</FONT><BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; DePalma's explanation for this peculiarity was simply that the interaction of the primary magnetic field with that produced by the radial output current results in a <I>shear torque</I> between the conductive disk and the field pieces which <I>is resisted by mechanical attachment</I>, and so is wholly constrained within the rotor assembly and not reflected back to the mechanical drive! <FONT COLOR="#000099">The experimental evidence seems to indicate that the aforesaid <I>purely theoretical</I> assumption is <I>not</I> true</FONT>, however, as we'll see.<BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; DePalma's 'discovery' [circa 1977] that a unipolar generator's field pieces should be nonconductive to avoid the production of magnetic back-torque is illustrated by the &quot;N-effect&quot; diagram at left below &#150; and could in fact be arrived at through simple deductive reasoning. If a rotating cylindrical magnet produces a stationary field, and the magnet itself is conductive (e.g., Alnico), then a voltage should appear between the center and outside surface by Faraday's Law of Induction! The trouble is that the act of drawing any load current from such a set-up will once again produce a classical level of back-torque, by Lenz's Law.</p>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Why DePalma called the device of his design shown on the right above an &quot;N-machine&quot; is something of a mystery, since it is in essence merely a typical unipolar generator.

<FONT COLOR="#990099"><B><U>Review of Prior Art</U>:</B></FONT> In an ongoing effort to develop a self-sustaining unipolar generator system that just might be able to serve as a stand-alone residential power plant, Bruce DePalma and his principal correspondent-collaborator Paramahamsa Tewari built and tested very large, unwieldy, and expensive apparatus in reliance on the inherent design scalability of the Faraday machine. A number of perceived &quot;improvements&quot; over the basic technology were also implemented, but the <I>underlying logic</I> with which these changes were selected and made was perhaps inherently flawed &#150; with negative consequences for both the cost-effectiveness and the coefficient of performance (COP) of the <FONT COLOR="#990099"><I>equipment</I></FONT> [examples of which may be seen at the DePalma website (<A HREF="http://depalma.pair.com/index.html" target="NewWindow">depalma.pair.com/index.html</A>) and at <A HREF="http://www.tewari.org" target="NewWindow">www.tewari.org</A>.<BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; The famous <I>Kincheloe Report</I> (1986) on the testing of one of DePalma's larger N-machines may be reviewed at <A HREF="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/free_energy/dpalma5.html" target="NewWindow"><FONT COLOR="#0000CC">www.totse.com/en/fringe/free_energy/dpalma5.html</FONT></A>. Despite the fact that DePalma made a number of questionable design choices in the &quot;Sunburst&quot; device tested by Robert Kincheloe (Professor Emeritus, Electrical Engineering, Stanford Univ.), <FONT COLOR="#003399">the data suggests that the back-torque losses were only about 20% of generated power &#150; instead of the classical <U>></U>100%.</FONT> Prof. Kincheloe also states that: &quot;while DePalma's [output] numbers were high, his basic [free energy] premise has not been disproved&quot;; and &quot;there is indeed a situation here whereby energy is being obtained from a previously unknown and unexplained source.&quot;<FONT SIZE="-2"> &nbsp; <A HREF="#intro"><FONT COLOR="#CC0099"><I>top of Introduction</I></FONT></A> &nbsp;  &nbsp; <A HREF="#top"><FONT COLOR="#660099"><I>top of page</I></FONT></A></FONT><FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><BR></FONT>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; These two pioneering experimenters and many others seem to have made <FONT COLOR="#CC0033">a primary assumption for which we have so far found little supporting evidence<B>:</B> that a disk dynamo-motor could be shaft-coupled to a unipolar generator, which in turn powered it, <I>to great advantage</I>.</FONT>  It might then seem that even if the dynamo-motor itself was not over-unity in nature, the external input electrical power required could be substantially reduced since the two devices have very similar [but difficult to match] voltage and current characteristics. But an <I>under-unity</I> machine of the original stator-and-rotor disk dynamo design would only be as efficient if used as an electric motor as it was as a generator<B>:</B> its motor efficiency would <I>not</I> significantly exceed that of today's best electric drive equipment, and the increased rolling load would tend to offset any &quot;power gain factor&quot; by requiring proportionally greater operator input power and cost.<BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; The question arises whether such a combination could become input self-sustaining if an <I>over-unity</I> disk induction dynamo was somehow designed and incorporated. And in fact, mathematical modeling suggests that this <I>might</I> be possible, in that <FONT COLOR="#000099">the dynamo's <I>power output goes up by the 4th power of increases in the rotor radius</I> while its input power requirement goes up by the square thereof.</FONT> However, in accordance with the earlier-stated relative equivalence of motor/generator action in almost all rotating electrical equipment, there is every empirical reason for believing that <I>such a Faraday &quot;dynamoelectric&quot; motor could only produce as much torque as it requires as a generator</I> under full load. Therefore, even if a given disk dynamo was able to exhibit a full-load COP of 2 (for example) when used as a generator to convert input torque to <I>output current</I>, it would exhibit a COP of <I>only 1/2</I> or <B>0.5</B> when used as a motor to convert full-load <I>input current</I> into output torque!! Thus, <FONT COLOR="#CC0033">piggybacking the two Faraday machine variants on a common shaft, in hopes of &quot;bootstrapping&quot; the dual device to a state of self-sustaining operation, would actually tend to be self-defeating from a <I>practical</I> standpoint.</FONT><BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, both DePalma and Tewari elected at some point to try replacing the permanent magnet fields with externally-powered electromagnetic coils, but then a special &quot;test cabinet&quot; source was necessary to supply proper power to these field coils &#150; in addition to the <FONT COLOR="#990099">grid power always required by the primary drive motor</FONT>! This had the minor advantage of making the unipolar generator's DC  output fully variable and reversible. However, a flat coil or solenoid produces a nonuniform magnetic field whose flux density falls off with increasing distance from its radial centerline, unlike the uniform field established between facing permanent magnets. With the addition of ferromagnetic cores, the relatively weaker fields of the facing electromagnets could then be greatly augmented and homogenized &#150; and AC power output could even be obtained &#150; but only at the expense of proportionally-increased <I>inductive coupling losses</I> [that could only be minimized by using cores made of a very nonretentive field grade (~3% Si or other low-carbon) steel alloy, such as C1010.]<BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; Although the N-machine and Tewari's &quot;Space Power Generator&quot; have been claimed to exhibit COPs approaching 3.0 (or more), <FONT COLOR="#990099">these devices were never made capable of self-sustaining operation nor were they (of course) ever cost-effectively mass-produced and marketed</FONT>. And while Tewari maintains that the technology &quot;is indeed commercially viable and should be brought to the attention of the general public&quot;, he notes that prospective manufacturers &quot;do not see a market for a low-voltage, high-current machine.&quot;</p>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>We feel that successfully bringing an over-unity induction dynamo system to market may actually be <I>achievable</I></U>, and that the secret to doing so is quite simple<B>:</B> use a back-to-basics &quot;systems approach&quot; to develop a very straightforward yet sophisticated design which avoids all of the unnecessary pitfalls just cited, one which is <I><FONT COLOR="#000099">self-sustaining</FONT> once started with standard 12vdc car batteries</I> and whose DC output is made <I><FONT COLOR="#000099">inverter-ready</FONT> using advanced solid-state current converters</I> for output voltage pre-amplification.

The design theory which we will examine and develop below clearly suggests that this is possible; nevertheless, the system overall <I>might not <B>yet</B> be cost-effective under &quot;normal&quot; circumstances</I> <B>. . .</B><FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><A NAME="tesla"><BR></FONT>

 <FONT COLOR="#6600CC"><I><U><B>Tesla and Back-Torque Theory</B></U>:</I></FONT> There is ample evidence to support both the view that back-torque will be produced in <I>any</I> Faraday disk machine <I>and</I> the claim that <FONT COLOR="#003399"><I>'drag'</I> may be artfully reduced to much less than a classically-figured level.</FONT> Oddly enough, the notion that rotor back-torque might not be produced in one type of Faraday machine or another can probably be traced back to <B>Nikola Tesla</B> &#150; and an obscure 1891 paper entitled <FONT COLOR="#0000CC">&quot;</FONT><A HREF="./Tesla_notes.html" target="NewWindow"><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I>Notes on a Unipolar Dynamo</I></FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#0000CC">&quot;</FONT>. If taken out of context, Tesla's blunt statement that &quot;such a machine differs from ordinary dynamos in that <I>there is no reaction between armature and field&quot;</I> was perhaps misconstrued as an absolute in the case of the statorless variant<B>:</B> little was known about it, since no one could <I>otherwise</I> see any good reason to rotate the extra mass of the field pieces, and everyone <I>knew</I> that back-torque was normally produced in a typical fixed-stator dynamo.<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#333366">[Significantly, perhaps, Tesla makes no mention whatever of the statorless Faraday generator variant in this paper. It should also be clarified that while some people may refer to such a statorless homopolar machine as a &quot;unipolar&quot; generator, it's more correct to let the latter term signify &#150; as it did for Tesla &#150; that <I>such an acyclic-voltage device produces pure DC current having only one constant polarity</I> (as in a battery), whether or not the field pieces are stationary.]</FONT><BR><BR></FONT>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; However, careful review of the paper reveals that Tesla was referring specifically to the case where we <FONT COLOR="#003399">&quot;assume the current [is] to be taken off <B>. . .</B> by contacts <I>uniformly from all points of the periphery of the disc.&quot;</I></FONT> His analysis suggests that when a load current is drawn, <U><B><I>eddy currents</I></B> will be confined to those radial sectors of the disk which do not lie directly between the shaft and an outer pickup brush</U>. In other words<B>:</B> regardless of whether we rotate the field pieces or not, or whether they're conductive or not, <FONT COLOR="#000099">if we collected the load current from a continuous peripheral brush which enclosed the entire edge of the disk, no rotor eddy currents could be generated and the 'normal' level of counter-torque would <I>not</I> be present.</FONT> [Its heavy eddy currents are of course a well-known major component of a <I>typical</I> disk dynamo's total magnetic losses. In the analytical model being developed here, radial brush-sector current is seen as strictly <I>laminar</I> in nature, while eddy current flow in intermediary sectors is turbulent.]<BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; What Tesla is really saying, then, is that <FONT COLOR="#000099">the more uniformly a disk dynamo's output current is drawn through the periphery of the disk, the less &quot;armature reaction&quot; can be supported by eddy currents <I>within</I> the disk</FONT> &#150; which are induced by the stator magnets and therefore attracted to them. [This could also be seen to validate the earlier contention that a disk machine whose output had been sufficiently optimized to allow it to function as an over-unity generator would constitute a proportionally <I>under-unity</I> motor!]

<FONT COLOR="#333366" SIZE="-2"><BR><BR>[<U>Note</U>: We can further show that no significant reduction of the Lenz losses expressed in a disk dynamo can be made, even with <I>ideal stator shielding</I>, until the angular width of the primary (radial conduction) &quot;brush sectors&quot; &#150; which is equal to the width of each pickup brush &#150; exceeds that of the adjacent 'neutral' (transverse deflection) &quot;eddy current sectors&quot;. Of course, the potential value of a practical liquid metal brush system which provided 100% rotor disk edge 'coverage' is also apparent &#150; in that <I>such a dynamo's Lenz losses could theoretically then be entirely eliminated</I> when ideal stator shielding is also employed &#150; and is no doubt the reason why the U.S. Navy imposed secrecy and gag orders on inventor Adam Trombly.<BR><BR></FONT>

 &nbsp; &nbsp;<U>It is very important to realize at this point that Lenz losses in a fixed-stator disk dynamo may take <I>two</I> (2) forms: <I>eddy current coupling</I>, and <I>stator inductive coupling</I></U>. In the first case, a full classical level of rotor counter-torque will tend to be produced due to the attractive magnetic drag or &quot;friction&quot; caused by direct polar coupling between the applied stator field and induced microcirculatory rotor eddy currents.<BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; As it turns out, though, a full classical measure of <I>similar</I> Lenz losses may <B>also</B> be produced by the stator, as a result of simple attractive polar coupling between the <I>net</I> rotor magnetic field [as expressed by &quot;uncompensated&quot; or asymmetrically-balanced primary load current distribution] and any (i) exposed (unshielded) outer stator magnet poles or (ii) incompletely field-piece-saturated stator shielding.<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><BR></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#333366" SIZE="-2">[<U>Note</U>: An &quot;ideal stator shielding design&quot; is one wherein <I>the field piece assemblies exhibit no external magnetic field outside of the flux gap</I> (as in the &quot;closed-path&quot; configuration developed by Adam Trombly.]<BR><BR></FONT>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus, to the extent that stator coupling occurs, it will act to produce <I>additional</I> magnetic drag upon the rotor which is linearly proportional to the load current drawn &#150; and thereby to satisfy &quot;Lenz's Law&quot;. We may further infer that, even with perfect (ideal) stator shielding to prevent any load current inductive coupling, a <I>fully-proportional</I> Lenz-loss eddy current counter-torque load <I>will</I> still seek to develop, to the extent possible (or allowed) unless the rotor disk is highly sectored with pickup brushes.

 &nbsp; &nbsp;<U>We can arrive at a new and much clearer picture of the nature of <I><B>reactive stator losses</B></I> in this device, by means of the following unbroken chain of logic</U><B>:</B><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR></FONT>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&#150; (i) <FONT COLOR="#000099">The magnetic field produced by <I>any</I> disk rotor current(s) must rotate with the motion of the disk</FONT>, being in opposition to the stationary field(s) applied by permanent magnets, or no motor action would result with an applied input current (instead of applying torque); and<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#150; (ii) <FONT COLOR="#000099">this rotor current field must fully enclose the disk without intersecting it</FONT>, or it would act either to generate a &quot;free&quot; voltage or to influence the disk's own inertia (neither of which can occur, classically).<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#150; (iii) Ordinarily, in the absence of an applied axial field, the rotor current field would then take up a simple symmetrical dual toroidal configuration (above and below the rotor plane) because of the disk's radial geometry. But in this case, it must establish the attenuated field configuration that's shown in the diagram on the right below, because <FONT COLOR="#000099">flux lines never cross &#150; and those of the rotating current field can't intersect those comprising the stationary axial applied field</FONT> (in which nearly all of the disk is immersed).<BR><FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR></FONT>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="./disk-current.html" target="newWindow" onclick="window.open('new.html','newWindow','toolbar=no,directories=no,menubar=no, scrollbars=no, resizable=no,width=600,height=400');"><IMG ID="Picture5" HEIGHT=132 WIDTH=275 SRC="./disk-current.v2a.jpg" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=8 ALIGN="CENTER" BORDER=0 ALT=""></A> <A HREF="./rotor-field.html" target="newWindow" onclick="window.open('new.html','newWindow','toolbar=no,directories=no,menubar=no, scrollbars=no, resizable=no,width=600,height=420');"><IMG ID="Picture6" HEIGHT=156 WIDTH=275 SRC="./rotor-field.v2a.jpg" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0 ALIGN="CENTER" BORDER=0 ALT=""></A><BR><FONT SIZE="-2"> &nbsp;<BR></FONT>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&#150; (iv) Moreover, it can be seen that the rotor current field completely encloses not only the disk <I>but the applied stationary fields as well</I>. Therefore, <FONT COLOR="#990099">the disk's rotating current field may inductively couple to any ferromagnetic material on or near the field pieces</FONT>, which can thereby cause the stationary applied field to impart additional armature reaction (or back-torque) to the rotor, unless that material is magnetically <I>saturated</I> due solely to induction by the field pieces.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#150; (v) Toroidal fields exhibit an inherently unfixed &quot;radial polar tendency&quot;, and will polarize attractively to any applied axial polar field <I>when radial torque is applied to them</I>. Thus, <FONT COLOR="#990099">any extant <I><U>net</U></I> rotor field due to <I>self-generated current(s)</I> will experience 'drag' against the stationary applied field</FONT>, regardless of its own polarity (and disk current flow direction), as classically it must. In practice, <I>end-pole keeper plates</I> can be used to nearly eliminate any magnetic interaction between induced rotor current and the field pieces <I>themselves</I> &#150; even if they're metallic <I>and rotating</I>.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#150; (vi) Most importantly, however, it can be shown by integral calculus that <FONT COLOR="#000099">the primary rotor current's <I>net</I> magnetic field around the disk is <I>inversely proportional</I> to the extent to which that current is drawn in opposite radial directions</FONT> (i.e., by pairs of 180&#176;-spaced brushes), because the net load current enclosed [by the path of integration] is then <B>zero</B> &#150; due to equal currents flowing in opposite directions &#150 thereby <U>mathematically confirming the fundamental validity of Tesla's guiding design principle</U>!<BR><FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR></FONT>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; Recalling now that <I>a conductor must move relative to a stationary field for voltage to be induced</I>, we may also deduce the following design first-principles: (1) to wit, <FONT COLOR="#000099">the primary rotor current field will <I>not</I> act to induce eddy currents in metallic stator magnets</FONT>, which in turn impose no corresponding additional back-torque (as Lenz losses); but (2) however, <FONT COLOR="#990099">when metallic magnets are used for the applied field in a <I>'unipolar generator'</I>, there <B>is</B> relative motion between a rotating conductor and a stationary field, so field piece eddy currents <I>will</I> be induced</FONT> which may couple to the rotor field and contribute to back-torque!<BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; Taken together, the preceding material clearly shows that &#150; <I>with ideal stator shielding</I> &#150; <FONT COLOR="#000099">back-torque will only be expressed in an <I>induction dynamo</I> (with a fixed stator) to the extent that eddy currents are allowed to circulate in &quot;unused&quot; radial sectors of the disk*</FONT>, and this principle can now be used to figure what percentage of the classical eddy current back-torque will be produced<B>:</B> it is simply (but not strictly) <I>proportional to the ratio of that portion of the disk's circumference which is</I> not <I>&quot;covered&quot; by its collector brushes</I> to <I>its entire circumference!</I><SUB>&nbsp;</SUB><BR>

*<FONT COLOR="#333366" SIZE="-2">[Note that this presumes of course the load current is shared equally by uniformly-spaced pairs of oppositely-vectored brushes! Many different brush system configurations are possible for any given size dynamo; e.g., we will employ a total of 64 brushes in the <A HREF="#magnadyne"><FONT COLOR="#3333FF"><B><I>preferred embodiment 18&quot;-dia. prototype</FONT></I></B></A> we are currently building.]<BR></FONT><BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;</FONT>This same <FONT COLOR="#0033CC"><I>reduced back-torque ratio</I></FONT> also applies, of course, to a 'unipolar' generator. Unfortunately, it can also be seen why only the much-less-powerful nonconductive (ceramic) magnets have generally been used in the statorless variant, since <FONT COLOR="990099">induced field piece eddy currents can transfer magnetic load to the rotor field <I>in a statorless generator</I> if the magnets used are metallic</FONT> &#150; because the load current's rotating magnetic field encloses the combined stationary fields of the permanent magnets and tends to polarize attractively to them.

[The rotor magnetic field that is produced by an <I>applied</I> disk current would (of course) polarize repulsively, resulting in motor action in the <I>absence</I> of an applied radial torque &#150; but only in the fixed-stator variant, it would seem . . .]<BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, in this regard, it could be said that <FONT COLOR="#000099">in a Faraday disk generator the motor field encloses the stator field, <I>and not the reverse</I></FONT> &#150; as almost universally is done in common electromechanical practice. Perhaps the possibilities inherent in this unusual arrangement are part of the mystery and fascination these machines have always held for the engineering-inclined.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; In any event, in the linked <A HREF="#top"><I>Analysis</I> sections</A>, we will calculate the input torque, output power, and efficiency (or <I>coefficient of performance</I><FONT SIZE="-2"> </FONT>) of both an induction dynamo and a unipolar generator <I>of the same physical size</I>, for both the classical case and the adjusted theoretical model developed from the refined design principles just discussed. It is then up to the reader to empirically decide which results are the more accurate!<BR>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Before proceeding to the <I>Analysis</I> sections, however, a review of the <A HREF="./over-unity2.html"><FONT COLOR="#9900CC">Getting Back to Basics</FONT></A> section is highly recommended. In this section, we will show the derivation of some essential formulae which properly govern and define the basic operating characteristics of both the Faraday disk dynamo and its unipolar generator variant (i.e., voltage, power, torque, etc.)<SUB>&nbsp;</SUB><B>. . .</B><BR>

<p align="justify"><FONT SIZE="-1"><B><U><FONT COLOR="#000099"> AESI's <I>Magnetic Induction Dynamo Project</I></U><I>:</I></B></FONT>&nbsp; Back in early 2005, we announced the formal inception of our exciting <FONT COLOR="#6600CC"><I>Magnetic Disk Dynamo Project</I></FONT>, in joint venture association with Algo Machine Shop Ltd. of ON, Canada. The fundamental purpose of AESI's Disk Dynamo Project is quite simply to determine if a &quot;new&quot; Faraday generator of our own unique and sophisticated design can actually be built and publicly demonstrated <I>to operate <B>over-unity</B></I> &#150; when so many others have tried and failed. While this design is of course based to a degree on landmark prior art, we're fairly certain that no one has ever built a device of the particular configuration defined in our Project Manual's specifications, nor is it very likely they had a better theoretical and mathematical model from which to proceed than that above. <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&#155;&#155;&#155;</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-2"><A HREF="#dynamo_photos"><I>PROJECT PHOTOS</I></A></FONT><BR>

<FONT SIZE="-1"> &nbsp; &nbsp; At the present time, when even the energy supply required to maintain our modern civilization is itself uncertain, <FONT COLOR="#000099">we're building an experimental Dynamo which might not only constitute a <I>feasibly marketable electric power supply system for residential customers</I> but should also be essentially production-ready if it proves successful!</FONT> Theoretically, the model under development could exhibit a &quot;net input COP&quot; of <B>1.49</B> or more, in which case it would be sufficiently over-unity that it could operate &quot;closed-loop&quot; as driven by a high-efficiency electric motor and custom inverter!<BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; Although the power output of a disk dynamo goes up proportional to the 4th power of increases in the rotor's mean induction radius, we wanted to design our device with a &quot;slim&quot; housing diameter that would not be significantly greater than that of a typical residential water heater and, in this way, we made the fortuitous choice of 18.0 inches as the Dynamo's nominal rotor disk diameter. 
And, because the vertical shaft will be electrically &quot;live&quot; in the chosen design, we wanted the 18&quot;-dia. prototype unit to be modular in nature so that multiple units can be mechanically coupled end-to-end in stages and driven by a single electric motor (or other suitable source of input torque) until the combined <I>net</I> output is commensurate with the electrical power needs of a typical residential housing unit!
<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><A NAME="update.90407"><BR></FONT>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#000099"><B>>>></B></FONT>&nbsp; The typical U.S. household requires about 1,100 kWh of electrical energy per month, or 1.5kW on a continuous-duty basis. <FONT COLOR="#000099">The 18&quot; Dynamo's projected nominal power output capability is <B>2.5 kW</B></FONT> (1.49 vdc x 1,692 A, at 1479 rpm), although a net rating of 2,100 watts must be observed due to converter-inverter transformation losses. 
Each Dynamo stage will require 2 Hp in electric motor input (or about 1,800 W) for an accurately estimated 300 watts per stage of &quot;free&quot; (net) power output!<BR>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; In other words, according to the best theoretical model possible, a closed-loop system comprising five (5) of our prototype 18&quot; Dynamos &#150; coupled end-to-end mechanically (and in parallel electrically) and driven by a single 10-Hp motor &#150; <I>should</I> have more than enough capacity on continuous duty to offset the entire electric power requirements of the average American home!<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><BR></FONT>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; While it is possible &#150; but extremely unlikely &#150; that our prototype Dynamo will not be <I>that</I> much more efficient than (for example) a high-performance Bosch truck alternator (~70%), <U>we will actually consider this Project to be a gratifying success upon <I>any</I> of the only other possible outcomes</U>:<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><BR></FONT>

1) we just might be able to meet Dr. Hal Puthoff's &quot;1-watt challenge&quot; (as yet unachieved anywhere <I>else</I>, so far as we know) and <I>demonstrate true self-sustaining operation</I> of an electric-motor-driven device that can also power at least one (1) watt of additional load [and perhaps 300 W ...];<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><BR></FONT>
2) failing that, we may well still be able to <I>solidly verify over-unity operation</I> of an electromotive device &#150; if only for the academic accomplishment of it &#150; if, for instance, we develop well over 1,000 watts of net output across the buss bars using less than 1,000 watts worth of input shaft torque; or<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><BR></FONT>
3) we may find that the Dynamo's <I>overall efficiency</I>, despite all those brushes, is in fact less than but <I>quite close to 100%</I>, and that because of its very low-voltage/high-current output characteristics we can manufacture and market it as <FONT COLOR="#000099">a near-perfect <I>direct-connection</I> power source for water electrolyzer cells</FONT> used in the commercial production of gaseous hydrogen!<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><BR></FONT>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; The 18&quot; Dynamo's projected net buss bar output voltage is 1.49 vdc at a max. rotation of 1900 rpm, just marginally greater than the theoretical optimum (ideal) water electrolysis voltage of 1.23 vdc, with no power conversion or transformation whatsoever required and with a corresponding max. load current of nearly 1,700 amps! It is therefore hard to conceive of a more efficient electrolytic cell power source . . . [The efficiency of water electrolysis is inversely proportional to cell voltage, whereby the higher efficiency is attained at the smaller cell voltage for any given electrolytic current.]<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><BR></FONT>

 <FONT COLOR="#000066"><B>></B> We expect to see the latter of the three likeliest outcomes of this Project, as discussed above, to be realized <I>at the very least</I>, which means we <I>probably</I> have a viable product on our hands! It remains to be seen if the modular 5-stage motor-driven Dynamo system we'd like to build can be made cost-effective enough in production for the American consumer market.</FONT><FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><BR></FONT>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; The theoretical proof sheets developed in our <I>Disk Dynamo Project Manual,</I> wherein the performance potential of the 18&quot;-dia. prototype model is carefully assessed for the electric motor drive scenario, are both sobering and exciting! They provide clear insight into just how difficult it has been for experimenters and prior art inventors to unlock the latent over-unity potential of the Faraday disk dynamo, as well as how difficult it will be to develop a marketable residential power plant from it. Some have expressed the opinion that we are devoting valuable resources to a program which &quot;tries to use an age-old model to deal with new-age problems&quot; &#150; that we are only <I>tilting at windmills,</I> as it were! Be that as it may, even if we are unable to verify OU operation in first-round testing, our Dynamo 1 prototype is a beautiful piece of unconventional equipment which will teach us a great deal, which expresses some very adroit engineering, and which just may prove to be a very significant and newsworthy scientific achievement.<FONT SIZE="-2"><SUB>&nbsp;</SUB></FONT><BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; The two rugged load-bearing housing frames, whose required configuration was very difficult to fabricate, are shown stacked with the stator shielding end plates, magnetic matrix blanks, and copper rotor disk all properly interleaved. Once the individual magnets are imbedded in the 2 stator heads (ea. comprising an end plate and magnet matrix) and the copper shaft and its hybrid ceramic bearings are installed, the induction disk dynamo itself will be about 2/3 complete!<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; The next photo (on the left) shows one of the stator shielding end plates, drilled and countersunk for 108 flat-head machine screws which will distribute the expected ~1,500 lbs. of flux gap force to each supporting endframe. The three groups of 3 holes that face the corner support lugs will be used to mount one of the 2 shaft brush holder baseplates. On the right is the hi-density acrylic-resin blank that forms the <A HREF="./over-unity3.html#magnets" target="NewWindow"><FONT COLOR="#0000CC">magnet matrix core</FONT></A> of one complete stator head, once it is epoxied to the end plate and drilled to accept a total of 173 NdFeB disk magnets.<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><BR>

 &nbsp;&nbsp; The two photos above show the finished stator head assemblies, with both the acrylic matrices now drilled for installation of the disk magnets and epoxied into their respective stator shields. Within the present limits of our computing power, this complex magnet layout pattern is intended to achieve as uniform a radial current density within the rotor disk as possible, hopefully such that the current through each collector brush is equal to within +/- 5% or less &#151; despite the decidedly non-homogenous distribution of magnetic material. Individual brush resistance measurements and repetitive low-speed testing will reveal which matched pairs of brushes should be located at what oppositely-positioned radial locations to correct for inevitable variances in the observed rotor current density.<BR><BR>

<A HREF="./superstructure2.html" target="newWindow" onclick="window.open('new.html','newWindow','toolbar=no,directories=no,menubar=no, scrollbars=no, resizable=no,width=600,height=400');"><IMG ID="Picture13" HEIGHT=191 WIDTH=295 SRC="./dynamo_assy.114.jpg" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=8 ALIGN="CENTER" BORDER=0 ALT=""></A> <A HREF="./rotor2.html" target="newWindow" onclick="window.open('new.html','newWindow','toolbar=no,directories=no,menubar=no, scrollbars=no, resizable=no,width=600,height=420');"><IMG ID="Picture14" HEIGHT=191 WIDTH=255 SRC="./dynamo_rotor.jpg" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0 ALIGN="CENTER" BORDER=0 ALT=""></A><BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp; On the left above is the complete dynamo superstructure, ready for installation of the individual magnets and drive hardware. All of the many small mounting bolts seen in the photo are steel, to magnetically fill the resultant holes in the stator shielding. However, these will be cut off flush with their tightened nuts, which must themselves be stainless steel, so that an absolute minimum of ferromagnetic material is incorporated in the entire superstructure. Ideally, the two 3/16&quot;-thick stator shields will be <I>saturated</I> by the open (unused) poles of the magnets so that <I>neither can support any induction which opposes the rotor drive.</I> The corner support legs are cut from <FONT SIZE="-2">ACME</FONT>-threaded brass rod.<BR>

 &nbsp;&nbsp; The 1/4&quot;-thick rotor, 1.375&quot;-dia. shaft, and disk mounting flanges seen at right are all cut from pure (99.9% electrolytic) copper. The specialized hybrid (ceramic) bearings are <I>radially non-conductive,</I> since the shaft is &quotlive&quot;, and have silicon nitride balls which run 'dry' on races coated with tungsten disulfide (as a surface-active quasi-lubricant).<BR><BR>

<A HREF="./superstructure3.html" target="newWindow" onclick="window.open('new.html','newWindow','toolbar=no,directories=no,menubar=no, scrollbars=no, resizable=no,width=600,height=420');"><IMG ID="Picture15" HEIGHT=230 WIDTH=307 SRC="./dynamo_assy.115-3a.jpg" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=8 ALIGN="CENTER" BORDER=0 ALT=""></A> <A HREF="./superstructure4.html" target="newWindow" onclick="window.open('new.html','newWindow','toolbar=no,directories=no,menubar=no, scrollbars=no, resizable=no,width=600,height=420');"><IMG ID="Picture16" HEIGHT=230 WIDTH=253 SRC="./dynamo_assy.116-7a.jpg" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0 ALIGN="CENTER" BORDER=0 ALT=""></A><BR>

<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR></FONT> &nbsp; &nbsp; The photo at left above shows both stator heads now finished, with all 173 magnets satisfactorily imbedded in each magnet matrix. The total field produced is astonishingly strong, and is more powerful at the circumference than at the center, such that a ball bearing placed anywhere on the steel back plate tends to roll quickly toward the outer edge! Obviously, this means that the degree of outer pole shielding obtained is less than perfect (as expected); but, another 1/16&quot; of back plate thickness should be enough to 'sink' this leakage flux so that it can't contribute any armature back-torque. If the back plate is too thick, however, it will be <I>unsaturated</I> and could partially polarize attractively to the armature current field &#150; which would again create back-torque by magnetic drag! [When saturated, the back plates can't carry or support any further external induction.]<BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; The uniformity of 'deck height' achieved in both magnet installations is very good, and should allow for final disk-to-magnet clearance (on both sides) of ~0.010&quot; or less on the average. [The design output model is based on 0.009&quot; clearance, and with fine-tuning a figure of 0.008&quot; may be obtainable (since even such a small improvement would entail a marked increase in gap flux density). On the right is of course the complete fundamental superstructure and mechanical (drive) assembly. The shaft is surprisingly hard to rotate manually &#150;
 since, without brushes and an external circuit current, <I>all</I> of the input torque will go to producing rotor disk eddy currents and input-proportional back-torque!<FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp;<BR><A NAME="update.040208"><BR></FONT>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; The next big step in the Dynamo's construction will be to add a total of 48 collector or &quot;pickup&quot; brushes around the perimeter of the stator heads. The rotor's two-piece brush holders have now been fabricated, the mounting-screw-holes for which can be seen in the photos at right and above. A collector buss bar will encircle the Dynamo at its radial centerline, and a precision-resistance test load shunt (with which to properly assess the Dynamo's performance and efficiency) will be connected between the collector buss and the rotor shaft by means of twin shaft brush holder assemblies and buss bars.<BR>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; The roll-around motor stand will make working on the heavy Dynamo and its many brushes much easier; and it's sturdy enough to allow for the stacking of several &quot;modular&quot; Dynamo units on the same chassis. Our new test motor is a variable-speed permanent magnet DC drive (1750) rated at 5 Hp, but it's still only powerful enough to barely turn the rotor without extracting any radial load current. To the extent that they are not successfully suppressed by virtue of design, eddy current losses in our Dynamo will be inversely proportional to the radial current, with stator losses being proportional thereto.
