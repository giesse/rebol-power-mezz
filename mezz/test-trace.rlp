Test trace

    Type: Module
    Purpose: {
        Allows creating test traces to simplify automated testing of systems
        (like network servers / protocols etc.) which are not "functional" in
        nature and thus not easy to "unit test".

===Introduction

Automated testing is very simple when you have simple functions, and
you can just call them in your tests and check the result. If the result
is not the one expected, you know you have a problem.

However, how do you do something like this for a network server (for example)?
It's not like the server will "return a result" that you can check, most of the times.

Here I'm proposing a simple solution to this kind of problems. You "instrument" the server
to produce, while testing, a "test trace". Then, you can treat the test trace as the "result"
of running the server in that specific test.

===Overview

In the software you want to test, you add calls to |append-test-trace| in order to build
a "trace" of what is happening during the test. The trace should be so that it is a function
of the test case, that is, the same test case will always produce the same trace, unless there
is a bug somewhere.

The challenge here is to make sure that your trace does not change if you refactor your code
or change it to a different implementation. (Although, you can always change your tests if
necessary, when you do it's much harder to "trust" your changes to the code.)

|value| can be anything, and it is just appended to the "trace" (after |reduce|'ing it if 
it's a block).

    -main-:
    append-test-trace: func [
        "Add a value to the current test trace"
        value
    ] [
        -append-test-trace-
    ]

Normally, when you're not running a test, |append-test-trace| does nothing, in order to
keep the overhead of the instrumentation to the minimum. You can switch to "test mode"
by calling |start-test|:

    -main-:
    start-test: func [
        "Start a test session (create test trace)"
    ] [
        -start-test-
    ]

So, in your tests you would do something like:

    start-test
    call-code-to-be-tested
    result: end-test

where |end-test| returns the "test trace" (as a |block!|).

    -main-:
    end-test: func [
        "End a test session and return test trace"
    ] [
        -end-test-
    ]

Please note that calls to |start-test| and |end-test| cannot be nested.

===Start a test session

We just clear the |test-trace| block and replace |append-test-trace| with the "real"
version (otherwise normally that function is a no-op).

    -start-test-:
    test-trace: clear [ ]
    append-test-trace: :actual-append-test-trace

===End a test session and return the test trace

We reset |append-test-trace| to the "fake" version, and return the |test-trace| block.

    -end-test-:
    append-test-trace: :fake-append-test-trace
    copy test-trace

===Append |value| (reduced if needed) to the |test-trace| block

By default, |append-test-trace| does nothing.

    -append-test-trace-:
    ; do nothing

So, this is actually the |fake-append-test-trace| that is used outside of testing.

    -main-:
    fake-append-test-trace: :append-test-trace

The "real" one is the following and it is only used while testing:

    -main-:
    actual-append-test-trace: func [
        "Add a value to the current test trace"
        value
    ] [
        repend test-trace :value
    ]
